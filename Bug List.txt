Game 1 Scima Idle Bug List
- equip/unequip of item does not change current display value of cost
- drops on kill don't update inv panel if not on item
- IdlerUpgradeGroup - why can't i make the list of subclass work :/
- does RoundBigNumber work? stay tuned ryan sucks
- idlers don't display by default
- idler cost upgrade doesn't update level up button
- make joe die
- make mana stop at zero

Features that I never quite figured out
- How to use T : F<T> for items
- how to make weighted roll even more (less) retarded
- optimize updates to DPS/DPF
- consider a framework for backing BigNumber<int> implementation? or leave Rounded as is.
- make level up tooltip show total increase
- change effect spawner to instantiate a reference, method called from the PlayerClicker.
